Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce 5.0 Based on 512 reviews powered by G o o g l e review us on Bob Lin 20:31 14 Mar 25 While it was clearly a beautiful event, and the hotel did a magnificent job with food service, both in timing and quality given the number of people, our chamber team makes the same mistake that most Galas make.While I have now sold my company, 25% of our revenue came from corporate meeting planning. Our clients were major fortune 500 companies so I have some perspective on this.The speeches and in particular the videos were way too long !One only has to observe the audience to know when it is gone on too long.My strong suggestion is that the time allotted for each videos next year literally be cut by 50%.Speeches should also be cut at least by 33%.Especially given the ever increasing number of awards.Once we got around halfway through the awards, you could look around the tables near by and see everybody was just done and being polite sitting there.

    "answer": "A unique travel experience awaits! | Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce A unique travel experience awaits! I have always dreamed of traveling. Visiting new places, experiencing history up close, learning about different cultures and meeting new people. I never thought I could afford it or thought, how would I go if I were by myself. Where are the best places to go? Where do I stay, how do I plan? So many questions, I just kept putting the trip off. Then came the experience of a lifetime, my opportunity to travel with the chamber. As someone who’s quite seasoned in my career, it’s easy to feel like I’ve hit a plateau. But just when I think I’ve seen it all, traveling with the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce remind me how much there is still to learn. Looking up at the Leaning Tower, I was struck by how something can stand the test of time, even when it tilts in an unexpected direction. Perspective is everything and solutions, ideas, and growth often come when we shift our view, embrace a new angle, and open ourselves to fresh experiences. Chamber travel isn’t just a hassle-free, pre-planned trip, it’s a catalyst for change. It’s a bridge between cultures, a chance to see the world through a new lens, and an opportunity to forge meaningful connections beyond business. Travel has a way of reigniting curiosity, opening doors to new ideas, new friendships, and even new business opportunities all while experiencing the richness of a destination alongside a community that shares your drive to keep evolving and other professionals that share your curiosity. I am the lucky Chamber staff member now embarking on my fifth trip with the Chamber. We’ve been to Greece, Italy, Spain, Morocco, and Ireland, and this year, we’re off to Croatia, a lifelong dream of mine! Each trip has been a unique experience, but one thing remains the same: the incredible group of people it attracts. From local and national business owners to couples and solo travelers across a variety of industries, these tri\n\nLearn more: https://carlsbad.org/a-unique-travel-experience-awaits/"

At Vista Community Clinic (VCC), we go beyond the standard approach to primary care by offering a full suite of services that treat the whole person. From Family Medicine to Optometry, Dental services, Acupuncture, Chiropractic Care, Podiatry, Cardiology, Behavioral Health, Wellness Programs, and more, VCC provides an integrated, one-stop healthcare solution that ensures patients receive coordinated and effective care. Unlike traditional healthcare settings that require patients to juggle multiple locations, referrals, and medical records, VCC brings everything under one roof. Our team of clinicians collaborates closely, ensuring that each patient benefits from a streamlined experience where communication about their care is seamless. Where one clinician’s expertise ends, another begins, making for a truly comprehensive approach to health and wellness. Whether it’s managing chronic conditions, addressing acute issues, or providing preventative care, VCC’s coordinated approach helps patients achieve optimal health outcomes and enhances the care experience, leading to more accurate diagnoses, quicker treatments, and a more personalized healthcare journey. For example, if a patient comes in for a routine check-up with their primary care clinician, and that clinician notices a potential issue that could benefit from chiropractic care or acupuncture, the clinician can easily refer them to the right specialist. The same goes for patients seeking podiatry or dental care, with seamless referrals within our clinics. This integration also reduces the frustration of dealing with multiple diagnoses and sharing medical records between various providers, helping ensure that every clinician is on the same page when it comes to your care.

But it would become an indelible part of her legacy. As president and one of the founding members of the Lawrence E. and Neva B. Fenstermaker Foundation, Brooks has been instrumental in supporting STEM at Cal State San Marcos for nearly CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN MARCOS 30 years. While the Fenstermaker Foundation is now sunsetting, its legacy will live on through a $1.3 million endowment in perpetual support of STEM students at CSUSM. This transformative gift will be further amplif ied by a $1 million matching contribution from the Epstein Family Foundation. “Supporting STEM has been one of the most rewarding parts of my life,” Brooks said. “Three decades ago, we chose CSUSM because it was new and so full of potential. This university is exactly what we needed in North County San Diego, and it has been wonderful to watch it grow.” Over the years, in addition to the recent endowment, the Fenstermaker Foundation has donated $1.9 million to STEM initiatives at CSUSM, providing more than 130 STEM students with scholarships and establishing a $40,000 library endowment for science resources. “We are deeply grateful to the Fenstermaker Foundation board of directors,” CSUSM President Ellen Neufeldt said. “Their generosity has transformed countless lives, creating a ripple effect of innovation and opportunity that will benefit our community for generations to come.” As a first-generation college student, Brooks put herself through school at Adelphi University in Brooklyn. At the time, it was rare for women to pursue higher education or build careers in fields such as biology, making Brooks’ achievements both groundbreaking and inspiring.

    "answer": "EUSD’s innovative approach to recess sparks engagement and inclusion | Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce EUSD’s innovative approach to recess sparks engagement and inclusion At the heart of Encinitas Union School District (EUSD) are five core values that guide the work we do every day: joy, belonging, service, innovation, and integrity. These values shape everything from program development to school culture and help inform key decisions as we continue to grow. One area where these values are especially evident is in our approach to lunchtime recess. Recess is a vital part of the elementary school experience—a time when students can unwind and refresh. For many, it’s synonymous with playing sports and climbing on playgrounds. While these activities remain beloved, EUSD recognizes that not all students are drawn to physical play every day. That’s why this year, we have focused on expanding recess opportunities to better serve all students and foster a greater sense of joy and belonging. Since the start of the school year, we’ve introduced a wide variety of options during lunchtime recess to cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students. The goal is to ensure every student has a space where they feel engaged, comfortable, and ready to thrive. One of the most exciting changes is the rise of student-led clubs. At each campus, students are stepping up to organize groups based on their passions. A great example is our Green Teams, where students collaborate on sustainability projects to make eco-friendly changes in their school communities. This initiative provides students with the opportunity to take ownership of their environment while building valuable teamwork skills. In addition to student-led clubs, EUSD’s enrichment teachers—specialists in art, STEM, music, P.E., and garden/nutrition— have expanded recess choices. Garden clubs are flourishing, with students planting seeds and helping maintain school gardens. Science clubs provide space for innovation, where \n\nLearn more: https://carlsbad.org/eusds-innovative-approach-to-recess-sparks-engagement-and-inclusion/"

The aim is to recognize and celebrate companies that prioritize kindness. BENEFITS OF BECOMING A KINDNESS CERTIFIED COMPANY Participating in the KCC program offers numerous advantages: TALENT ATTRACTION: A reputation for kindness makes companies more attractive to prospective employees seeking meaningful work environments.

To associate with people you know, like and trust look to one of the Chamber’s five Netforce groups. If you value the benefits of warm referrals from trusted advisors to clients, look to a Netforce group. Netforce offers a ready “bench” of skilled professionals, Masterminds, to know, like, trust and REFER. Groups meet on different days and times. They each meet weekly, limit membership to a single person in any given field or specialty. The meetings focus on getting to know Netforce members and businesses so that referrals can flow to and from members naturally. Each group is self-governing. Our group, Netforce 3, is typical. We meet Wednesday mornings 8 to 9 a.m. and meeting agendas are distributed Tuesdays. At each meeting, one member provides a half hour presentation (and then Chairs the next meeting) telling us more about their business, abilities, needs and wants. Our injury lawyer has used the presentation to roundtable cases, our lender to provide insight into rates, our insurer to alert us to the changing insurance world, our REALTOR to bring tips on selling or buying a home, our promotional marketing “merch” member to initiate spirited marketing conversations, our managed IT member to scare us about the online world, and our financial advisor to open eyes about financial growth. During meetings, members seek advice from our collective mastermind, offer member referrals, thanks, testimonials, or insight from meeting with another member. Explore Netforce, visit, or guest at several for the right fit. We encourage your to explore our 5 Netforce groups and find one that fits you.

    "answer": "Nickel for your thoughts? | Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce Nickel for your thoughts? I love learning new words. I am not sure how I made it through nearly six decades of living without hearing the word seigniorage! Just looking at the word impresses me! What is seigniorage, you may ask? Seigniorage is the difference between the face value of coins or currency and the government’s cost to produce said coin or currency. This is not a new concept, but it is getting media attention as the federal government considers doing away with the penny. The bottom line is that if the seigniorage is lower than the actual exchange value of the currency or coin, it is profitable to keep making/minting that currency. Pennies don’t pass the seigniorage test. Most sources say it costs approximately three cents to make a penny (some claim that it is up to four cents). According to APMEX.com, nickels don’t pencil either. They state that it costs about $.08 to make a nickel. Not that I have heard any discussion about discontinuing nickels yet, just thought I’d bring it up. This concept got me thinking, what else do we pay for that isn’t worth what it costs? Granted, opinions will vary on this topic, and different generations will value things differently – but let’s chat. Cable TV Subscriptions – I cut the cord long before streaming was even a thing, so it is hard for me to believe that cable TV subscriptions are still in existence at all, but apparently, they are. Is there anything even worth watching on cable? Plus, how do you binge on traditional cable? Lottery Tickets – government-sponsored gambling is not new to the scene. But with the odds of winning the lottery at about one in 300 million, is the so-called ticket even worth the cheap paper it is printed on? According to YouTuber Johnny Harris, in 2021 Americans spent over $100 billion on lottery tickets. Wow…how’s your ROI? The Sunshine Tax – as my years continue to steamroll by me, I am starting to wonder if the high cost of SoCal l\n\nLearn more: https://carlsbad.org/nickel-for-your-thoughts/"

    "answer": "About The Chamber | Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce Older Bolder EXPO Our Annual Expo features 30 vendor booths, workshops, raffles prizes and more. This will be a premier event for those looking for resources and guidance on living your best life after retirement! Featured at the premier event will be the latest information on products and services designed to make the most of life at any age. A lineup of expert speakers will talk about topics ranging from financial planning and navigating Medicare to home safety and adult learning. Dozens of exhibitors will offer the latest information and essential tips on aging successfully. “Most often we do not plan for what is being coined by gerontologists as the “third age,” states Alesia Clark, founder of Engage Life Care. “Beyond financial retirement plans, we must plan for all facets of our well-being for an extraordinary tomorrow.” Planning for the future not only includes caring for ourselves but also caring for parents and/or grandparents. One goal of the Expo is to provide helpful information and connections for caregivers. According to the National Council on Aging, so many Americans, whether they realize it or not, are caregivers. Approximately 40 million Americans provide unpaid care to older adults and adults with disabilities—the majority of whom also juggle a job or other responsibilities. Wearing all these hats can take its toll. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website states it is expected that there will be 71 million people aged 65 years old and older when all baby boomers are at least 65 years old in 2030. Planning for the future becomes even more imperative because the number of older adults needing help and services is quickly growing. “We are working hard to make the Expo a huge success,” said Bret Schanzenbach, President & CEO of the Carlsbad Chamber. “People are living longer, and many are working well into their seventies and even eighties.
